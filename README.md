# CSS Integration Third Interface
## What
This is another integration exercise in recreating an interface
pixel perfect. One interface was mandatory, others were at free will, with the possibility to earn new badges (HTML, CSS3, Github).

## Why
After doing our trial-run test we started to learn Javascript. After learning the basics we're going to make a project project with Javascript. This exercise is given to refresh our memories, before continuing to the harder parts of Javascript
## How
The interfaces were made with CSS and HTML only, no frameworks were allowed.
## Tools
- VsCode
- CSS
- HTML
- Lots of search engines
## Interfaces
