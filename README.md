# CSS Integration Third Interface
## What
This is another integration exercise in creating a pixel perfect interface. One interface was mandatory, other were at free will, with the possibility to earn new badges.

## Why
After doing our trial-run test we started to learn Javascript. After learning the basics we're going to make a project project with Javascript. This exercise is made to refresh our memories, before coninuing to the harder parts of Javascript
## How
The interfaces were made with CSS and HTML only, no frameworks are alowed.
## Tools
- VsCode
- CSS
- HTML
